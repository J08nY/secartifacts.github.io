The two main goals of the TCHES 2023 artifact review process were to improve **functionality** and
**reusability** of artifacts to enable reproducibility and extension by the scientific community.

**Reproducibility**, in the context of computational experiments, means that the scientific results
claimed can be obtained by a different team using the original authors' artifacts. The artifact
review process for CHES 2023 did not include attempting to reproduce the experiment and verify
the scientific claims in the accepted paper. Rather, the artifact review process for CHES 2023
aimed at ensuring sufficient functionality of the artifact to enable a research team to attempt
to reproduce the results.

**Reusability** means that the artifacts are not just functional, but of sufficient quality that
they could be extended and reused by others. Reusable artifacts have clear user and developer
documentation, and are well-structured in ways that make them easy to modify or extend.
