The two main goals of the TCHES 2021 artifact review process were to improve **functionality** and
**reusability** of artifacts to enable reproducibility and extension by the scientific community.

**Reproducibility**, in the context of computational experiments, means that the scientific results
claimed can be obtained by a different team using the original authorsâ€™ artifacts. The artifact
review process for TCHES 2021 did not include attempting to reproduce the experiment and verify
the scientific claims in the accepted paper. Rather, the artifact review process for TCHES 2021
aimed at ensuring **sufficient functionality** of the artifact to enable a research team to attempt
to reproduce the results. The artifact review process for TCHES 2021 also aimed to improve
**reusability**, meaning that the artifacts are not just functional, but of sufficient quality
that they could be extended and reused by others.
